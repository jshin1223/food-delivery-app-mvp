## 📱 Mobile App (Future Plan)

Planned stack:

- **React Native + Expo** → Cross-platform development  
- **Stripe React Native SDK** → Payments  
- **React Native Maps / Google Maps API** → Restaurant search  
- **Shared Supabase backend** with the web app  
- **Monorepo setup** (Turborepo or Nx) for shared components and logic  

👉 This will allow customers to order via iOS and Android apps using the same backend.
